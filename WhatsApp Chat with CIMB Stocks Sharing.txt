Good morning. The local bourse got off to a subdued start in the morning session before the index clawed back into positive territory at the close of yesterday. The index is currently testing the long-term downtrend line from the 1,896 high. A strong close above the said trendline would be positive for the local market. However, a reversal from here would not surprise us as the recent overheated trading activities may trigger some profit taking. Resistance: 1,730 & 1,750. Support: 1,720 & 1,700.

27/02/2019, 08:31 - +60 12-919 0233: Bursa market outlook: *Further decline of KLCI expected*

Despite the optimism over the trade dispute, the FBMKLCI Index succumbed to selling pressure on Tuesday as oil & gas counters fell following the overnight decline in crude oil prices after Trump called on OPEC to ease high crude oil prices. The black candlestick on 26th Feb may have confirmed the sell signal triggered by the bearish reversal tweezers top pattern. Therefore, there is a high possibility for the index to fall further from here. The 50-day EMA will act as an immediate support. Resistance: 1,730 & 1,750. Support: 1,700 & 1,682.

01/03/2019, 08:35 - +60 12-919 0233: Bursa market outlook: *KLCI to see some insignificant bargain hunting in March*

There was no pre- and post-CNY stock market rally in February 2019. However, the growing optimism over the US-China trade talks in the third week of Feb was one of the main deviations from our expectation of decline. The FBMKLCI Index was up 24pts or 1.4% mom. As we head into the month of March, the follow-through buying interest in the local stock market is not likely to carry on as the index is expected to face strong selling pressure at or near the 200-day and 200-week EMAs. Shares on Bursa may see some bargain hunting activities but the upside may not be significant. Resistance: 1,730 & 1,750. Support: 1,700 & 1,682.

04/03/2019, 08:47 - +60 12-919 0233: Bursa market outlook: *Selling pressure may persist*

Despite the growing optimism over the US-China trade talks, the FBMKLCI index tumbled 20.7pts or 1.2% week-on-week after the uninspiring local corporate earnings release. Foreign funds have been the net sellers over the past 6 trading days while the overall market breadth was negative for 5 out of 6 days.

The local barometer is currently testing the 1,700 psychological level. Shares on Bursa may see some bargain hunting activities but we expect selling pressure to persist as the overall trend and market sentiment remain down given the series of lower highs and lower lows formation on its weekly chart. Coupled with the fragile momentum indicators, the key index could potentially decline further and breach the 1,700 psychological level, targeting a test of the 1,610-1,625 levels next. Resistance: 1,730 & 1,750. Support: 1,700 & 1,682.

08/03/2019, 08:42 - +60 12-919 0233: Bursa market outlook: *KLCI to see further consolidation*

Tracking the mixed performance across the regional markets, the FBMKLCI Index closed flat yesterday as US tensions with China reached new heights after Chinese tech giant Huawei filed a lawsuit against the US on Thursday. Given that Citigroup cut its target for the FBMKLCI index to 1,790 from 1,844 on Thursday following the disappointing local corporate earnings, more similar scenarios may be seen in the following days, in our opinion. Coupled with a lack of fresh catalysts, we are of the view that the local bourse may consolidate further today. Resistance: 1,700 & 1,730. Support: 1,682 & 1,670.

14/03/2019, 08:25 - +60 12-919 0233: Bursa market outlook: *Buying interest may carry on today*

The Bursa Malaysia Energy Index, which rose 2.6% to 1,063.01 amid strong crude oil prices, continued to lead the local bourse’s advance on Wednesday. Despite fresh uncertainties over Brexit, the FBMKLCI Index was up 6.9pts yesterday. The key index seems to be responding positively to the bullish harami candlestick pattern so far and hence buying interest is expected to carry on today. We think that the local oil & gas counters may gain strong traction from the overnight rally in crude oil prices. We recommend a trading buy on *Pantech Group Holdings* today. Resistance: 1,680 & 1,700. Support: 1,665 & 1,650.

Tracking the mixed performance across the Asian stock markets, the FBMKLC Index dropped 3.7pts as the weak China’s industrial output weighed on market sentiment. Trading volume continued to grow since Tuesday, surging to 4.7bn shares valued at RM2.7bn on Thursday alone. The weak index with a strong volume generally has NOT been a positive combination. Hence, the buying interest in shares on Bursa may run out of steam today. The local bourse could potentially head lower to test 1,650 and eventually the December low of 1,626. Resistance: 1,680 & 1,700. Support: 1,665 & 1,650.

Investors do not seem to be responding positively to the news coming out from the 15th Invest Malaysia Conference as the benchmark FBMKLCI close 3.3pts lower yesterday. Instead, investors may be closely watching the outcome of the US Fed meeting later tonight.

The overall market sentiment may remain tepid today as investors await more impetus from the market. Any bullish news coming from the FOMC meeting may trigger significant buying interest in shares on Bursa. Resistance: 1,690 & 1,707. Support: 1,665 & 1,650.

The FBMKLCI Index was not spared as well with the benchmark falling 17.5pts yesterday. Yesterday’s gap-down move has formed a new series of lower lows and lower highs from the 1,732 high. The market may continue to see many ‘zombie pedestrians’ walking on the street today amid growing recession worries as well as weakening technical indicators. Resistance: 1,665 & 1,685. Support: 1,650 & 1,627.

Meanwhile, we think that some selected manufacturers (such as Rubber Glove, Packaging, Semiconductor, Steel, Auto, Brewery, and Consumer Staples); Hospitals; and also Convenience Store players may gain traction from the recent government’s proposal to reduce the rate of electricity tariff.

27/03/2019, 08:34 - +60 12-919 0233: Bursa market outlook: *Bullet ricochet off water* 

The FBMKLCI Index see-sawed between dips and gains on Tuesday as the growing recession worries kept the markets on the edge. Despite the improved Asian market sentiment, the key index only managed to chalk out a marginal gain of 0.79pts on Tuesday. Some bargain hunting activities in the local stocks may creep in today in response to the overnight rebound on Wall Street as well as rally on oil prices. However, the growing recession worries and weakening technical indicators of the local barometer may continue to act as a drag on the overall sentiment. We think that some selected oil & gas counters, such as *Dayang Enterprise* may gain traction from the overnight rally on oil prices. Resistance: 1,665 & 1,685. Support: 1,650 & 1,627.

01/04/2019, 08:44 - +60 12-919 0233: Bursa market outlook: *Roller Coaster month* 

The FBMKLCI index plunged 64.1pts month-on-month in March, dragged by the disappointing local corporate earnings as well as the potential impact of a 25bp cut in OPR in 2019. On the external front, the growing economic slowdown worries continued to weigh on market sentiment. 

The bears attacking the stock market in March were in line with our expectation. Going forward, the index could potentially stage a technical *rebound during the first half of April* as the index formed a bullish morning star formation near the 1,639 low, which suggests a potential reversal to the upside. If our expectation of the said rebound takes place, some *profit-taking activities may creep in in the second half of April* and subsequently carry forward into the month of May where ‘sell in May and go away’ old adage may come into play. Hence, we are of the view that traders who missed the chance to take profits or cut losses in March may want to do so in April. Resistance: 1,657 & 1,675. Support: 1,640 & 1,627.

03/04/2019, 08:18 - +60 12-919 0233: Bursa market outlook: *Pigeon taking off at slow speeds* 

Monday’s gains on the Wall Street as well as a rally in crude oil prices were one of the main deviations from our expectation of decline yesterday. The FBMKLCI Index rebounded 4.2pts or 0.26% to close at 1,632.83 yesterday, led by the heavy buying in stocks listed on the Bursa Energy Index. The December 2018 low of 1,627 was not tested. Instead, the index appears to have formed a Homing Pigeon candlestick pattern following the sharp decline on Monday. Homing Pigeon is a sign of a reversal to the upside. Hence, the index could potentially stage a technical rebound today. However, any rebound is likely to be capped at the 1,657-1,670 levels. Resistance: 1,640 & 1,657. Support: 1,627 & 1,617.

05/04/2019, 08:32 - +60 12-919 0233: Bursa market outlook: *Homing Pigeon flies higher* 

Tracking the mixed performance across the most Asian stock markets, the FBMKLCI Index eked out a marginal gain of 1.9pts on Thursday. Investors appear to be adopting a wait-and-see stance as they await further developments on the US-China trade talks. Despite the tepid performance, market breadth has remained upbeat for the last 5 trading days in a row.

The index has formed a Homing Pigeon candlestick pattern on Monday, which is a sign of a reversal to the upside and it seems to be taking off right now. Coupled with the indicators slowly turning up, buying interests could potentially carry on today. However, any rebound is likely to be capped at the 1,657-1,665 levels. Resistance: 1,657 & 1,665. Support: 1,627 & 1,617.

Despite the strong gains on Wall Street last week, the FBMKLCI Index eked out a marginal loss of 1.8pts week-on-week to close at 1,641.81. The market seems to need more impetus to push up the index.

As long as the reversal signal triggered by the Homing Pigeon remains valid, we are on the lookout for a technical rebound towards the 1,657-1,665 levels.  Resistance: 1,657 & 1,665. Support: 1,627 & 1,617.
